### Blob tx(s) post utility

A blob tx gen utility for seeding devnet5 (or subsequent devnets/testnests with blobs)

## Prerequisites

1. Bash terminal
2. `ethereumjs-monorepo` codebase build via `npm i` (for e.g. at `/usr/app/ethereumjs`)

Note: All commands should be run from the `client` package directory root (so something like `/usr/app/ethereumjs/packages/client`)

## How to run

1. Clone the repo set to branch `develop-v7` and run `npm i` with nodejs `18` installed and latest npm version
2. Run the blob gen utility (replace PRIVATE_KEY with a funded account private key and RPC_URL with an authenticated rpc url):

```ts
  cd packages/client
  PRIVATE_KEY=ae557af4ceefda559c924516cabf029bedc36b68109bf8d6183fe96e04121f4e RPC_URL=https://rpc.lodestar-ethereumjs-1.srv.4844-devnet-5.ethpandaops.io npm run tape -- test/sim/4844devnet5.spec.ts
```

It runs with current chainId of `4844001005`, if you want to override pass `CHAIN_ID=` env param in above command
currently it posts 2 txs, but that can be modified with another env variable `NUM_TXS`

You can manipulate the fees for the txs using env variables in the following way (for e.g. to replace a low fee stuck tx):

`GAS_LIMIT=0xffffff MAX_FEE=1000000000 MAX_PRIORITY=100000000 MAX_DATAFEE=100000000 RIVATE_KEY=ae557af4ceefda559c924516cabf029bedc36b68109bf8d6183fe96e04121f4e RPC_URL=https://rpc.lodestar-ethereumjs-1.srv.4844-devnet-5.ethpandaops.io npm run tape -- test/sim/4844devnet5.spec.ts`
